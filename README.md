# PETOrders Documentation

PETOrders is the NIH PET Department's internal web application for
ordering radiopharmaceutical products. Lab members (customers) place
orders for products by nuclide. PET Department staff process those
orders through a simple lifecycle (pending, accepted, completed).
Administrators manage accounts, the product catalog, the
institute/lab/PI directory, and reporting.
