# PETOrders — Admin Guide

This guide is for administrators. Admins can do everything staff can
(process orders, see the [Staff Guide](USER_GUIDE_STAFF.md)), plus
everything covered here: approving registrations, managing customer and
staff accounts, maintaining the catalog (nuclides and products) and the
directory (institutes, labs, PIs), and exporting reports.

Two rules that shape almost everything below:

- **Nothing is ever deleted.** Nuclides, products, institutes, labs,
  PIs, delivery locations, and accounts are deactivated, which only
  affects what can be chosen going forward. History is never touched.
- **PETOrders never sends email.** Every temporary password the system
  generates is shown to you exactly once, on screen. You relay it to
  the person via NIH email yourself.

## 1. Your dashboard

![Admin dashboard with stat tiles and review panels](images/admin/dashboard.png)
_The admin dashboard: pending registrations front and center, plus account counts and recent activity._

| Panel                           | What it shows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Stat tiles                      | Pending Registrations, Active Customers, Active Staff, Admins (each also shows its inactive count). Click a tile to jump to the matching list                                                                                                                                       |
| Pending Registrations           | The review queue's newest entries, with a **Review** link into the full page                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Recently Rejected Registrations | Recent rejections with the reason, for quick reference when someone follows up                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Recently Added Customers        | The newest customer accounts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Lockouts — Past 7 Days          | Accounts that recently hit the failed-login lockout (5 wrong passwords locks an account for 15 minutes). Useful when someone reports they "can't log in": if they're on this list, they can wait out the 15 minutes, or you can reset their password, which also clears the lockout |

## 2. Reviewing registration requests

New customers request access themselves via the public registration
form. Requests land in **Registrations**, and no account exists until
you approve one.

![Registrations queue with pending requests and Approve/Reject buttons](images/admin/registrations-queue.png)
_Each pending request shows the applicant's details and their chosen institute, lab, and PI._

Each row shows the applicant's name, email, institute, lab, PI, phone,
and submission date. A **"Previously rejected"** badge flags applicants
who have been rejected before (hover it to see the last rejection
reason).

**To approve:** click **Approve** and confirm. In one step, this creates
the customer's account (their email becomes their username) and
generates a temporary password, shown in a banner:

![Approval banner showing the one-time temporary password](images/admin/registration-approve-temp-password.png)
_The temporary password appears exactly once. Copy it before leaving the page._

Copy the password immediately (there's a Copy button) and send it to
the applicant via NIH email. It's never shown again. If you miss it,
open the customer's page and use **Reset Password** to generate a new
one. The customer must change this password the first time they log in.

**To reject:** click **Reject**, enter a reason (required), and click
**Reject request**.

![Reject registration dialog with the required reason field](images/admin/registration-reject-modal.png)
_Rejecting requires a reason._

The reason is kept on record for admins (the dashboard's Recently
Rejected panel, and the "Previously rejected" badge on any resubmission).
The applicant's status page tells them only that their request was not
approved and to contact an administrator, so be prepared to explain the
reason if they get in touch. Rejected applicants can submit a new
registration.

## 3. Managing customers

**Customers** lists every customer account.

![Customers list with search and institute/lab filters](images/admin/customers-list.png)
_Filter customers by name or email, institute, lab, and Active/Inactive status._

Click **View** on a customer to open their page:

![Customer detail page with editable details and account actions](images/admin/customer-detail.png)
_A customer's page: account info, editable details, and account actions._

**Editing details:** you can change their name, phone, institute, lab,
and supervising PI (customers can't edit any of this themselves). One
rule to know about lab and PI changes:

| Situation                         | Result                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keeping the current lab and PI    | Always saves, even if that lab or PI has since been deactivated. A name or phone edit is never blocked by it                                                                 |
| Changing to a different lab or PI | Requires the new choice to be active, and the lab and PI must be paired (the PI is on that lab's roster, see section 7). Inactive entries show "(inactive)" in the dropdowns |

**Deactivate Customer** signs them out immediately and blocks future
logins. Their order history stays fully intact and visible, nothing is
hidden or cancelled. **Reactivate Customer** restores access.

**Reset Password** generates a new temporary password (their current
password stops working immediately, and any lockout is cleared):

![Temporary password banner after a customer password reset](images/admin/customer-reset-password-banner.png)
_Like approval passwords, a reset password is shown once, for a short time. Copy it right away and relay it via NIH email._

The banner is deliberately short-lived: it appears once and expires
after about a minute. If you miss it, just run Reset Password again.
Admins never see or choose a user's actual password, only these
one-time temporary ones.

## 4. Managing staff and admin accounts

**Accounts** lists all staff and admin accounts, filterable by role and
status.

![Accounts list with role and status filters and the + Account button](images/admin/accounts-list.png)
_Staff and admin accounts in one list._

**To create an account:** click **+ Account**.

![New account dialog with email, name, and role choice](images/admin/account-new-modal.png)
_Creating an account: the email becomes the username; pick Staff or Admin._

Enter their email address (this becomes their username), first and
last name, and choose the role: **Staff** (processes customer orders)
or **Admin** (everything staff can do, plus management and approvals).
Click **Create Account**, a one-time temporary password banner appears,
same rules as always: copy it now, relay via NIH email, it forces a
password change at first login.

**On an account's page** you can edit their name, and use the account
actions:

![Account detail page with profile and account actions](images/admin/account-detail.png)
_An account's page. Note the safeguards on your own account._

| Action                          | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deactivate / Reactivate Account | Deactivate signs them out immediately and blocks logins. Reactivate restores access. Two safeguards: you cannot deactivate your own account, and you cannot deactivate the last active admin, the system refuses so there's always at least one admin who can get in |
| Reset Password                  | Same one-time temporary password flow as for customers. You can't reset your own password here, use Change Password like everyone else                                                                                                                               |

## 5. Catalog: nuclides

The catalog is two levels: nuclides, and the products made from them.
Customers always pick a nuclide first, then a product, so the nuclide
list is the top of the ordering funnel.

![Nuclides list showing product counts and status](images/admin/nuclides.png)
_Each nuclide shows how many products it has and whether it's active._

| Action     | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add        | Click **+ Nuclide**, enter the name, save                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rename     | Always allowed, any time. Renaming updates how the nuclide displays everywhere, including on past orders (it's a label correction, not a new nuclide)                                                                                                                |
| Deactivate | Takes the nuclide, and every one of its products, off the new-order form until you reactivate it. The confirmation spells out how many active products are affected. Past orders are untouched. Reactivating makes its active products orderable again automatically |

![Edit nuclide dialog](images/admin/nuclide-edit-modal.png)
_Renaming a nuclide._

## 6. Catalog: products

![Products list with nuclide and fulfillment columns and status filters](images/admin/products.png)
_Products, each tied to one nuclide and one fulfillment method._

Every product belongs to one nuclide and has one fulfillment method:
Radiopharmacy, Pick Up, or Direct Delivery. Fulfillment is a fixed
property of the product, never chosen per-order. To offer the same
product a second way, add a second product row with the other
fulfillment, the add form's hint says exactly this, and customers will
see the two options side by side when ordering.

| Topic                    | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add                      | Click **+ Product**, pick the nuclide (active nuclides only), name the product, choose the fulfillment                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Statuses in the list     | **Active** (orderable), **Inactive** (turned off), **Unavailable** (the product itself is active but its nuclide is deactivated, so customers can't order it until the nuclide comes back. That's your cue to check the nuclide, not the product)                                                                     |
| Editing, the in-use lock | Once any order references a product, its nuclide and fulfillment can no longer be changed (the fields lock, and the form tells you why). This protects order history. The correct move: create a new product with the right nuclide/fulfillment, then deactivate the old one. The product's name can always be edited |
| Deactivate / Activate    | Removes/restores the product on the new-order form. Activating a product whose nuclide is inactive is allowed, but the confirmation warns it stays Unavailable until the nuclide is reactivated                                                                                                                       |

![Edit product dialog with nuclide and fulfillment locked](images/admin/product-edit-locked.png)
_A product that's in use by orders: name is editable, nuclide and fulfillment are locked._

## 7. Directory: institutes, labs, and PIs

The directory drives registration: applicants pick their institute, then
a lab at that institute, then a PI on that lab's roster. The `active`
switches here control only what new registrants (and reassignments) can
choose. Existing customers, their orders, and their lab data are never
affected by deactivating anything.

**Institutes:**

![Institutes list with shorthand and lab counts](images/admin/institutes.png)
_Institutes, with optional shorthand (e.g. "NCI") and their lab counts._

Add with **+ Institute** (name required, shorthand optional). Renaming
is always allowed and updates the display everywhere, including past
orders. Deactivating an institute makes all of its labs unselectable
for new registrations until it's reactivated (the confirmation states
the count).

**Labs:**

![Labs list with institute, building/room, and PI/customer counts](images/admin/labs.png)
_Labs, each belonging to one institute. The Unavailable status means the lab is active but its institute isn't._

Add with **+ Lab**: pick the institute (active ones only), name the lab,
optionally add building/room, and set up its PI roster. The roster is
the important part:

![Lab dialog with the PI roster picker](images/admin/lab-edit-pi-roster.png)
_The lab's PI roster, this is the only place lab↔PI pairing is managed._

- This is the only place PIs are attached to labs. The PIs page has no
  pairing controls, to put a PI at a lab, edit that lab's roster.
- The roster is searchable, add PIs as chips, remove with the ×. When
  editing, each PI shows how many customers they supervise at this lab.
- Removing a PI from the roster does not affect the customers they
  already supervise, it only stops new registrants from choosing that
  pairing.

Deactivating a lab blocks it for new registrations. Its existing
customers, orders, delivery locations, and product users are unaffected
(the confirmation says so). Like products, a lab shows Unavailable when
it's active but its institute isn't.

**PIs:**

![PIs list with contact info and lab/customer counts](images/admin/pis.png)
_PIs, with their lab and customer counts. Pairing to labs happens on the Labs page._

Add with **+ PI** (name required, email and phone optional).
Deactivating a PI removes them from new-registration choices, the
customers they already supervise are unaffected.

## 8. Reports and CSV export

**Reports** exports order data as a CSV file for use in Excel or
elsewhere.

![Order Reports form with date range and filters](images/admin/reports.png)
_The report form: date range is required, everything else is optional narrowing._

1. Set **From Date** and **To Date** (both required, the range covers
   when orders were placed).
2. Optionally narrow by **Institute**, **Nuclide**, **Product**,
   **Status**, or **Chargeable** (Yes/No).
3. Click **Download CSV Report**. Your browser downloads a file named
   like `pet_orders_report_2026-07-23.csv`.

The CSV has one row per order with these columns: Order ID, Order Date
(Y/M/D), Institute, Nuclide, Product, Status, Chargeable, Cancellation
Reason. **Reset Filters** clears the form.
