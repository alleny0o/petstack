-- notes is the single shared, overwritable communication channel on an
-- order -- last-write-wins, no history or threading; staff/admin can
-- always edit it, a customer only on their own order. status has no
-- 'returned' value: a return is a transition back to 'pending', recorded
-- as a normal row in order_audit_log, not a status of its own. order_id
-- is a plain AUTO_INCREMENT: MySQL/MariaDB never reuses an
-- AUTO_INCREMENT value even after the owning row's status becomes
-- 'cancelled' (and this app never DELETEs orders), satisfying
-- "sequential, never reused" with no extra bookkeeping. product_user_id
-- is nullable -- NULL means the ordering customer is the recipient; a
-- row is only required when someone else is. delivery method is no
-- longer chosen per-order -- it's derived from the selected product's
-- delivery_method. location_id is nullable at the DB level -- most
-- delivery methods legitimately have no location -- but the app layer
-- treats it as required whenever the order's product has
-- delivery_method = 'direct_delivery'. That conditional requirement is
-- enforced in new_order.php's validation, not as a DB constraint -- a
-- plain NOT NULL can't be made conditional on another column's value
-- without a trigger, which is more complexity than this needs. There is
-- no cost column of any kind here -- this project does not track cost.
-- cancellation_reason is nullable at the DB level for the same reason as
-- location_id above: it's only conditionally required (whenever a
-- transition sets status to 'cancelled', from either the customer or
-- staff cancel path), which transition_order_status() (src/helpers.php)
-- enforces at the app layer rather than as a DB constraint. It's
-- structured data tied specifically to the cancel event -- distinct from
-- the general-purpose notes field above. chargeable is unrelated to the
-- order lifecycle: staff-only editable, freely toggleable regardless of
-- status, and never written to order_audit_log since toggling it is not
-- a status transition. It defaults to 1 (confirmed flip from the original
-- 0 default): a new order is chargeable unless staff say otherwise, so
-- "not chargeable" is the exceptional case the UI highlights.
